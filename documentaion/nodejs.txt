#Prior requirement:

"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.25",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4"
  }

1.npm init
2. npm install 
   "body-parser": "^1.19.0", // to extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and expose it on req.body 
    "cors": "^2.8.5", // to allow request from other orgin particularly from http://localhost:4200/
    "express": "^4.17.1", // is used start server at port (port of your choice)
    "mongoose": "^5.9.25", // to connect to database i.e mongodb
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4" // is used for auto restarting server when a change is made to content

3.create index.js  ( http://localhost:3000/tasks)

#Index.js:

here server is created using express. also used are cors, body-parser. here mongoose is connected to database by calling const mongoose= require('./db');
here router is used to direct request based on http service

#Db.js

is used to connect to database( mongodb) . this can also be configured using config file

#Taskdb.js:

is used to mention model of data i.e provide model for collection(table) in database(mongodb)

var task= mongoose.model('task',{
    task:{type:String}
});

Note: does not require as monodb create it automatically

#Taskcontroller.js:

uses router in express to route request to different http service (get,post,put,delete)
